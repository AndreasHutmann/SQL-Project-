# SQL-Project
Welcome to my SQL portfolio.  
In this project, I analyzed a shopping trends dataset using **MySQL** in the **DBeaver environment**.  

The analysis covers the entire workflow:
- **Data Cleaning**: handling missing values, checking duplicates, and validating business logic.  
- **Key Business KPIs**: calculating order count, total revenue, AOV, ARPU, repeat purchase rates, and subscription ratios.  
- **Segmentation Analysis**: breaking down purchase behaviors by age group, product categories, payment methods, discount sensitivity, and review satisfaction.  
- **Actionable Insights**: identifying which customer groups contribute the most revenue, which age segments are price sensitive, and where marketing strategies can be optimized.  

This work demonstrates my ability to use SQL for **discovering consumer purchase insights through retail data analysis**, from raw data exploration to generating insights that can inform marketing and product decisions.
