# SQL-Project

These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and optimize ad performance, track eCommerce funnel progression, and generate actionable insights from large datasets. From calculating campaign metrics to exploring conversion rates and user engagement, my work reflects a deep understanding of both marketing and product analytics.
