# ðŸ”¥SQL-Project
Welcome to my SQL portfolio.  

In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of an anonymized retail transaction dataset using MySQL in the DBeaver environment. The analysis follows a rigorous data science workflow, transforming raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence.

The analysis covers the entire workflow:
- **Data Cleaning**: operational noise, negative transactions, missing values (NULLs and empty strings)
- **Key Business KPIs**: Total Revenue, AOV, ARPU, Orders
- **Data Analysis**: Segmentation Analysis(age, subscription), Product-Centric Analysis, Time Series Analysis
- **Actionable Insights**:  

This work demonstrates my ability to use SQL for **discovering consumer purchase insights through retail data analysis**, from raw data exploration to generating insights that can inform marketing and product decisions.
